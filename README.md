# script-starter
Simple script that can be run in a project folder to easily start a new script file.

## Setup
- Download the file and add to a project folder
- Open thr DIR of the project in a terminal
- Run ``chmod +x ${filename}`` in the terminal
- Then Run the script in the terminal with the new file name as a parameter like this ``./starter.sh newfile``
